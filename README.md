# Hello-World
## This is my beginning repository with GitHub- created as part of the GitHub introductory lesson.
### I am starting this GitHub to accompish the following:
1. Be able to participate in the Code Platoon curriculum
2. Develop a working knowledge of Javascript and HTML
3. Eventually be able to develop my own web applications
